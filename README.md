# Measuring Influence

Let's say we have a function f(x). 

>Y = f(x) (say)

We know that dY/dx is proportional to:

>f(x+h) - f(x)

Now, what do I exactly mean by 'influential' here? 

By x is 'influential' to f(x), I mean f(x) changes quite a bit with little change in x.

x has little 'influence' on f(x) when f(x) barely changes even when x greatly changes. 

Since dy/dx is basically the measure of change in y or f(x) with respect to a negligible change in x,
|dy/dx| should be greater for cases where x is more 'influential' to f(x).

(Note: I am ignoring the direction of change, and focusing on the magnitude; thus |dy/dx| instead of dy/dx)

Now, if we have a function 

>y = f(x1,x2,x3), 

we can compare the individual 'influences' of x1,x2,x3 on f(x1,x2,x3) by
comparing the values of 

>|pd(y)/pd(x1)|, |pd(y)/pd(x2)|, and |pd(y)/pd(x3)| 

(where pd represents partial differentiation).

# Finding Influential Input Features

Now for an image classification neural model, we can consider y = h(x1,x2,x3....xn) as the representative function for the neural network. Here, x1,x2,x3....xn are input pixels of the images to be classified. 

Now we can compute the gradients |pd(h(x1,x2,x3...xn))/pd(xi)| for each input features. 

From there, we should be able to select some of the most influential input features i.e. the features for whose
the value of the gradients are higher than most of the others. 

# Object Discovery ?

Let's say we have an input image of a dog. The classifier network classifies that image to be a dog. Now intuitively, the most influential pixels of that image should be the ones near the object dog within the image. If the classifier is working properly, surely it should be the pixels that constitutes the 'dog' portion of the image, due to which the classifier classifies the image to have a dog. 

If that's true then according to the theory, we can find the approximately most influential pixels simply by computing the gradients as described before. 

Now, if the theory is right, we will end up finding the pixels that are near about the object-dog. If indeed that happens, we can acheive some level of object discovery without any further supervised or unsupervised learning; just by extracting latent learned information from a network trained in classification.

We might be even able to extrapolate the data and even create bounding boxes, or something like that, and acheive full on object detection. 

By modifying to network function by multiplying the output with some masking matrix such the result becomes the value of only one specific class, we may be even able to find pixels that specifically influences the certain class. 

# Implementation

I am working on a pre-trained model ([wide-residual-network](https://github.com/JRC1995/Wide-Residual-Network))

The data pre-processing script, the saved models and all else are available here: https://github.com/JRC1995/Wide-Residual-Network (inside OLD)

This implementation presented here is basically a toy implementation.

Ideally, I wanted to compute the gradients of the final model output w.r.t the input image data, however doing so resulted in gradient explosion. Normally in training, gradient doesn't explodes when batch normalization training phase is set as true. But while making predictions on single data, when batch normalization training phase is set as false, gradients explode.

So I only calculated the gradients of the output of the second convolutional block w.r.t the image data. 

I then sorted the absolute values of the gradients, chose a threshold value, and then marked all input pixels beyond the threshold as black, and all else as white.

We can <b>try to consider the positions of the black pixels to be trying to representing the positions of the pixels of the actual classification-object</b>, and from that perspective, we can subjectively evaluate the results.  

So, overall, this implementation is pretty rough around the edges: it's incomplete and also isn't evaluated with any objective metric.

This method, however, can also bring some layer interpretability.

Not much can be said from these results involving low sample size. 

If there are members of different classes in the same picture (say, a member from class 1, and another member from class 2), and if one needs to find the input pixels that are influential in the prediction of members in class 1 only, then a mask can be used over the model's output probability distributition to nullify the values corresponding to other classes - doing so should reduce the gradients of pixels that contributed to the values of other classes. Considering the direction of the gradients may also be important - for example to discover pixels that are likely to be around the objects of class 1, we may need to find pixels with a positive pd(class-1-output-probability)/pd(pixel_values). 

Apparently, there are prior mathematical works under the term 'sensitivity analysis' which deals with determining the 'influences' of input (or parameters):

It seems what I am doing here is 'local sensitivity analysis'.
